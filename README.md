# Home Assistant - WYZE Sense Component

> Special thanks to [HcLX](https://hclxing.wordpress.com) and his work on [WyzeSensePy](https://github.com/HclX/WyzeSensePy) which is the core of this component. His reverse engineering talents and development of WyzeSensePy made it quite easy to connect with WYZE sense devices.

Are you a visual person? Here's a [video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19UCwf4uidQ) of the setup and configuration. Check this README for the most up to date information.

WARNING: This component does not work on Mac OSX, Synology DSM, or other OSs that don't have hidraw drivers.

## Installation (HACS) - Highly Recommended
0. Have [HACS](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs) installed, this will allow you to easily update
1. Add `https://github.com/kevinvincent/ha-wyzesense` as a [custom repository](https://custom-components.github.io/hacs/usage/settings/#add-custom-repositories) as Type: Integration
2. Click install under "Wyze Sense Component", restart your instance.  
NOTE: You must have the Wyze Sense Hub removed from your device before installing the Wyze Sense Component and restarting your instance. If not, the setup may fail.
3. Plug in the Wyze Sense Hub (the usb device) into an open port on your device.

## Installation (Manual)
1. Download this repository as a ZIP (green button, top right) and unzip the archive
2. Copy `/custom_components/wyzesense` to your `<config_dir>/custom_components/` directory
   * You will need to create the `custom_components` folder if it does not exist
   * On Hassio the final location will be `/config/custom_components/wyzesense`
   * On Hassbian the final location will be `/home/homeassistant/.homeassistant/custom_components/wyzesense`
3. Plug in the WYZE Sense hub (the usb device) into an open port on your device.

## Configuration
Add the following to your configuration file and restart Home Assistant to load the configuration

The custom_component will use the contents of `/sys/class/hidraw` to determine which `hidraw` device is the Wyze receiver dongle.

```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: wyzesense
    device: auto
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Specify hidraw device
You can also optionally specify the hidraw device to use:

```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: wyzesense
    device: "/dev/hidraw0"
```
Most likely your device will be mounted to `/dev/hidraw0`. You can confirm the hidraw name of the device by running `dmesg | grep hidraw` to find out what hidraw number the bridge grabbed. Be aware that sometimes on restarts the hidraw device number will change. You can permanently fix the name (ex. as '/dev/wyzesense' in order to passthrough in Docker) by following the simple steps in [this comment](https://github.com/kevinvincent/ha-wyzesense/issues/66#issuecomment-569470754)

### Set initial states for sensors

By default, the component will restore the last state of the entity prior to a restart. If sensors change state during a restart, the change may not be reflected in HA. In order to combat this you can optionally specify an initial_state for sensors (by mac address) that will be set upon a restart. Be sure to put quotes around "on" or "off" so that they are strings not booleans.

```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: wyzesense
    device: "/dev/hidraw0"
    initial_state:
      77793176: "on"
      77793193: "off"
```


## Usage

* Call the services below to add and remove sensors from your WYZE Sense hub.

* If you have already bound sensors to the hub (for example using the Wyze Cam and Wyze App), they will be automatically added when the sensor is first triggered.

* Entities will show up as `binary_sensor.wyzesense_<MAC>` for example (`binary_sensor.wyzesense_777A4656`).
  * As like any other entity you can change the entity id and friendly name from the states page, which will stick even after restarts.

* Notes on Individual Sensors
  * Motion
    * State `on`: Motion Detected
    * State `off`: No Motion Detected
    * Wyze motion sensors will keep reporting the `on` state for 40 seconds after the last motion is detected. This is non configurable, but in practice it isn't a big deal and usually makes automations simpler.
  * Door
    * State `on`: Sensor open
    * State `off`: Sensor closed
    * Wyze door sensors will report `off` when the magnetized portion is within ~1 inch of the door sensor body.
* Notes on selected Sensor Attributes:
  * `rssi`: This stands for received signal strength indicator. Higher values (closer to 0) mean a stronger signal.
  * `battery_level`: The sensor does a basic calculation with the battery voltage. Because of this, battery percentage may be higher than 100% when you first get a sensor. Enjoy the longer battery life :)

## Services
For all services a persistent notification will be sent for both successes and failures.

### `wyzesense.scan`
* Call this service and then within 30 seconds, insert a pin into the hole on the side of a sensor and push until the red led flashes three times. The sensor will now be bound and show up in your entities. You will have to call this service once at a time for each sensor you want to add.

### `wyzesense.remove`
* Removes a sensor. Make sure you call this service with the correct MAC address of the sensor (which is the string of numbers and possibly letters that looks like `777A4656`). You can find this in the entity's attributes in the developer section.

## Troubleshooting
* Passing dongle hidraw device into Docker:
  * Please follow the steps outlined in [this comment](https://github.com/kevinvincent/ha-wyzesense/issues/66#issuecomment-569470754)
* Permission denied /dev/hidraw0
  * Additional Information
    * If you see this error on a Hassio installation please follow Reporting an Issue below. It is most likely an issue with your specific setup.
    * This is known to occur on Hassbian. This occurs when the group homeassistant is denied from accessing hidraw devices.
  * Solution
    * Create / Modify the file `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-com.rules` on your machine and insert `KERNEL=="hidraw*", SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw", MODE="0666"`
    * Restart your machine
* TimeoutError: _DoCommand
  * Ensure that you have updated to the latest component code. If you still see this error follow Reporting an Issue below.
## Reporting an Issue
1. Setup your logger to print debug messages for this component using:
```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.wyzesense: debug
    wyzesense.gateway: debug
```
2. Restart HA
3. Verify you're still having the issue
4. File an issue in this Github Repository containing your HA log (Developer section > Info > Load Full Home Assistant Log)
   * You can paste your log file at pastebin https://pastebin.com/ and submit a link.
   * Please include details about your setup (Pi, NUC, etc, docker?, HASSOS?)
   * The log file can also be found at `/<config_dir>/home-assistant.log`
